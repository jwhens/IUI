            <h1>How Many Cats is Too Many?</h1><p>Originally, I didn't even like cats. Seriously, I grew up deeply afraid of them and convinced my grandmother's cat was out to get me. Yet here I am, dedicating a webpage to my own. Funny how time changes.</p>
            <h2>I Have 3 Cats</h2><p>They have ingenius, literary names such as <b> Isaac Asimov, Sappho,</b> and <b>Beans</b>. Admittedly, Beans entered our home a few years after the first pair.</br>I mentioned I lived and worked in California, right? That's how I ended up with cats.</p>
            <h3>Working with Animals, You End up with a Zoo</h3><p>I worked for one of the largest animal shelters in California, and I was around a lot of animals all the time. I didn't consider myself to be an animal person, but I was around a lot of animal-loving people. I didn't hate animals, but I didn't love them as much as everyone around me. That being said, I liked them plenty well enough. This is how I ended up with my first round of kittens.</p>
            <h3>There should probably be more of a story here, or perhaps a video insert.</h3><p>Jasper is working on the video insert part, but we'll see if he actually delivers on it. It's the most difficult part of this unit, and he's terrible at video editing software. It's his least-favourite application software and he loathes editing videos. Inserting them into programming, sure, he can do that, but downloading, uploading, cutting, compressing and fitting an appropriate video into this website that'll be amusing as well as appropriate for this page? That takes time that he doesn't necessarily have. None the less, here we are.</p></br><img src="styles/images/youtube.png"><p>See, doesn't that look nice? It would be lovely if it played something. A mock-up is fine for now, though. You get the idea that something like that would be perfect for this page right about here.</p>

            <h2>Asimov & Sappho</h2><br><img src="styles/images/yinyang.jpg" alt="Asimov & Sappho sleeping"></br><p><b>Asimov</b>, who is more often than not called Asi or Bear-Bear, is an orange marmalade tabby who likes basking in sunshine, ripping cardboard, knocking over lamps, and crumpling paperbags. His sister and littermate, <b>Sappho</b>, is a white and brown long-haired tabby who enjoys fluffy pillows, rolling in dirt, and eating plain yogurt. They're a bonded pair that can't be separated, cuddling and sleeping together all day long every single day for the past almost seven years.</p></br><img src="styles/images/asimov1.jpg" alt="Asimov sleeping">
            <h2>Beans</h2></br><img src="styles/images/beans.jpg" alt="Beans sleeping"></br><p>The youngest cat of our home, <b>Beans</b>, was found behind a dumpster on the Tijuana border at around 3wk of age suffering from malnutrition and dying of a flea infestation. Defying the odds, she's been convinced she's invicible ever since. She enjoys running full-speed up and down three flights of stairs in the middle of the night, rifling through the garbage, and eating shredded cheese. Her favourite hobby is yodelling sonnets from the foyer at 3am to anyone who deigns to hear her. She is chaos incarnate.</p>
