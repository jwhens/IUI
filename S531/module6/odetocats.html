            <h1>How Many Cats is Too Many?</h1>Originally, I didn't even like cats. Seriously, I grew up deeply afraid of them and convinced my grandmother's cat was out to get me. Yet here I am, dedicating a webpage to my own. Funny how time changes.</br>
            <h2>I Have 3 Cats</h2> They have ingenius, literary names such as <b> Isaac Asimov, Sappho,</b> and <b>Beans</b>. Admittedly, Beans entered our home a few years after the first pair.</br>I mentioned I lived and worked in California, right? That's how I ended up with cats.
            <h3>Working with Animals, You End up with a Zoo</h3>I worked for one of the largest animal shelters in California, and I was around a lot of animals all the time. I didn't consider myself to be an animal person, but I was around a lot of animal-loving people. I didn't hate animals, but I didn't love them as much as everyone around me. That being said, I liked them plenty well enough. This is how I ended up with my first round of kittens.

            <h2>Asimov & Sappho</h2><br><b>Asimov</b>, who is more often than not called Asi or Bear-Bear, is an orange marmalade tabby who likes basking in sunshine, ripping cardboard, knocking over lamps, and crumpling paperbags. His sister and littermate, <b>Sappho</b>, is a white and brown long-haired tabby who enjoys fluffy pillows, rolling in dirt, and eating plain yogurt. They're a bonded pair that can't be separated, cuddling and sleeping together all day long every single day for the past almost seven years. 
            <h2>Beans</h2>The youngest cat of our home, <b>Beans</b>, was found behind a dumpster on the Tijuana border at around 3wk of age suffering from malnutrition and dying of a flea infestation. Defying the odds, she's been convinced she's invicible ever since. She enjoys running full-speed up and down three flights of stairs in the middle of the night, rifling through the garbage, and eating shredded cheese. Her favourite hobby is yodelling sonnets from the foyer at 3am to anyone who deigns to hear her. She is chaos incarnate.
