            <h2>So How'd I Get to Spain?</h2><p>I'm so glad you asked. I pursued my bachelor's at <b>Franklin College of Indiana</b>, graduating in 2018 with a degree in Creative Writing. I'd studied a lot of things before then, changing my major over eight times. They told me during my four years that changing your major was something that serious students didn't do, but I wasn't a serious student. I was a kid who had been shoved at college by my parents who very much wanted me to get a degree, and I had no idea what I wanted to study. So I spent four years studying whatever interested me, realising that I could, if I wanted, excel in almost any program. The choices were extremely overwhelming, and so was the freedom.</br>I had never lived outside of my hometown before then, I hadn't met a lot of people outside of my niche group of friends, I didn't know anyone who had a seriously different perspective than mine. Having access to a university's worth of knowledge with professors who cared about my unabashed pursuit of learning, I dove in head and feet first, burying myself in too many classes, too many ideas, too much of all of it. It didn't make me a good student, but it certainly made me an ambitious one. By the end of my sophomore year, I walked around with three majors, two minors, and two concentrated studies. I carried a classload of 19 credit hours a semester and could barely breathe on top of working nearly full-time. To this day, I'm not sure how I slept, but I know it wasn't often. My grades suffered, and so did I.</br>My junior year, it was noticeable how much I had over-committed myself across the board, academically, professionally, and personally. I had wrapped myself up so tightly and I was so exhausted that I could barely do much of anything. I was sat down with three of my professors, one of which was my advisor, and told that they were concerned about me. I had to drop a major for the sake of my health. I couldn't be everything, that was impossible. So I dropped a major and my extra-cirriculars, along with quitting my job. My grades improved. Later that autumn, one of those same professors offered me a placement in a study abroad program for January. He said someone had dropped out and they had an extra spot. He mentioned how he believed if anyone in the English department needed a breath of fresh air and an opportunity for a new perspective, it was me. So if I wanted to go, it was there. I talked it over with my parents and took the spot.</br></p>
		<h3>It Started in France</h3><p>I had just turned 21 and gotten engaged over Christmas break. My life was a mess, I can admit that in retrospect. However, I still showed up on New Year's Day 2016 to the airport with a backpack and a small carry-on suitcase to meet sixteen people from my university that I did not know and none of whom knew I was going on this trip outside of my professor. I was the last person to show up, and I'd never been abroad before. I didn't know French, I wasn't in the Modern Languages Department, and I'd never met the French professor before that morning, but she knew me.</br><i>"Bonjour!"</i>She greeted me with a hug, helped me check-in, and I found out then that she was married to my English professor. He laughed, and off we all went to Paris.</br>I spent the next month and some completely off-grid without cell service journalling, writing, reading, and travelling around France both by myself and in small groups with people who became my friends. I learned survival French, lived in Montpellier, and my entire life reoriented itself slowly. It took sleep, routine, clean air, good food, new places, and a lot of introspection with hardly any responsibilities aside from the one class I had. Our class was called "An American in France: Reflections on Culture" or something like that. A lot of our assignments involved immersive experiences like wandering the city, having lunch, and journalling about talking to people. We spent a lot of time resting, breathing, and talking about how deadly it was to always be under this pressure to perform and create, and what were we missing out on if we were always sprinting towards productivity? It was enlightening, and my professor was right. I did need it.</br>I returned to the States, dropped another major, dropped my internship for the spring, quit my job, reorganised my classes, and realised that in pursuing everything, I had stopped living. It took a while to get my grades up, but by my senior year, I was on the Dean's List. It was where I should've been all along, and I knew I could achieve at that level, but no one had seen how badly I'd burned myself out before it happpened. I'm extremely appreciative for the professors who did.</p>
		<h3>Then California</h3><p>After I graduated, I moved to California. I had gotten married during college, which I don't recommend to anyone, by the way, but it is what I did. My partner lived in San Diego and scored us a home, so off I went to join him less than five days after graduation. A one-way ticket and a backpack. I had sent ahead everything else we owned collectively. All he had to do was receive the boxes.</br>In California, I worked for the next five years in emergency telecommunications. This is where I picked up all of my technical skills, which I've mentioned here and there. It's also where I consider to be home more than anywhere else. California is a beautiful place, despite what anyone says about it. It features every type of biome the USA has, an incredible diversity of flora and fauna, and some of the most interesting and incredible people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I tend to believe that those who dislike California have never lived there.</p>
		<h3>Now Spain</h3><p>I don't really have a beautiful, magical reason for moving to Spain. My partner was offered a position overseas. We talked it over between us and decided it was a good opportunity for us. It gave me the opportunity to spend at least a few years on personal and professional development, and it gave him an incredible professional step up, so we had to take what was offered. The past few years, I've been writing and editing a book, which is something I wanted to do ever since I graduated undergrad but I'd never had the time to. I'm also here in this master's program, which is also something I didn't have time for before. My partner, likewise, has received multiple promotions as was promised to him. Spain has been good to us, plentiful and beautiful. We're happy to be here.</p>

            <h2>You've Lived A Lot of Places</h2><br>Yeah, I know. I like to experience the world as it is and as it comes. It's led me to a lot of places and seeing a lot of things.</br><img src="styles/images/theboys.jpg" alt="Myself & Friends at Stonehenge"></br>My friends and myself travel a lot around Europe. Last autumn, we went to London and ended up visiting Stonehenge as well after renting a car to experience driving on the opposite side of the road</br><img src="styles/images/drewandi.jpg" alt="My Partner & I in Prague"></br>Then, this December, my partner and I spent the holiday season trying to find Christmas, or rather how we all feel Christmas. We started in Prague and ended in Munich. Lots and lots of holiday cheer was in every corner of Europe, and somehow we avoided snow all December.

            <h2>Where Can You Find My Writing?</h2>I'm glad you asked.
            <p>I keep a Medium blog that's updated in-between my classes, which you can find here:<a href="https://jaymerrow.medium.com/">My Medium Blog</a></br>Other than that, though, most of my off-the-clock writing is kept to a Discord writing server that I run as a hobby for approximately 500 strangers from around the world.</br>My book is going to be hitting the query trenches this autumn if I reel back on my class schedule a bit. It depends on a variety of factors, but I'll let you know.</p>
