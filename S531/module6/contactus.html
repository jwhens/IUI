            <h2>Oh, I See</h2><p>You probably thought this was going to lead you somewhere special, like you'd have access to like a LinkedIn page or some socials or something. That would be rather professional of me, wouldn't it? </p>
            <h2>No, Nothing of the Sort</h2><p>This would be where something like that should go, though, if this were a professional website instead of a mock-up of what an autobiographical page were.</p>
