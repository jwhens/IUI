<h1>ARABIC</h1><h2>Agha Shahid Ali</h2><h3>1949-2001</h3>

<p><em>(A note on the ghazal: Traditionally, ghazals do not have titles and most were initially published either without titles or simply under "Ghazal." All of the ghazals in <b>Call Me Ishmael Tonight</b>, from which this ghazal is from, are titled after their refrain.)</em></p>

<div><p>The only language of loss left in the world is Arabic&#8212;<br>These words were said to me in a language not Arabic.</p><p>Ancestors, you've left me a plot in the family graveyard&#8212;<br>Why must I look, in your eyes, for prayers in Arabic?</p><p>Majnoon<!--footnotes?!-->, his clothes ripped, still weeps for Laila<!--you really need them-->.<br>O, this is the madness of the desert, his crazy Arabic.</p><p>Who listens to Ishmael?<!--I do have notes--> Even now he cries out:<br>Abraham, throw away your knives, recite a psalm in Arabic.</p><p>The sky is stunned, it's become a ceiling of stone.<br>I tell you it must weep. So kneel, pray for rain in Arabic</p><p>At an exhibition of Mughal miniatures<!--tons and tons on this guy and his work-->, such delicate caligraphy:<br>Kashmiri paisleys<!--all over this book--> tied into the golden hair of Arabic.</p><p>The Koran prophesised a fire of men and stones.<br>Well, it's now all come true, as it was said in the Arabic.</p><p>When Lorca died, they left the balcony open and saw:<br>his <i>qasidas</i><!--because of all the references--> braided, on the horizon, into knots of Arabic.</p><p>Memory is no longer confused, it has a homeland&#8212;<br>Says Shammas<!--and I'd put another one here-->: Territorialize each confusion in a graceful Arabic.</p><p>Where there were homes in Deir Yessein<!--and here, like citations-->, you'll see dense forests&#8212;<br>That village was razed. There's no sign in Arabic.</p><p>I too, O Amichai<!--or annotations-->, saw the dresses of beautiful women.<br>And everything else, just like you, in Death, Hebrew, and Arabic.</p><p>They ask me to tell them what Shadid<!--because of unfamiliarity with this world and culture. it deepens the meaning of the piece.--> means&#8212;<br>Listen: it means "The Beloved" in Persian, "witness" in Arabic.</p></div>
